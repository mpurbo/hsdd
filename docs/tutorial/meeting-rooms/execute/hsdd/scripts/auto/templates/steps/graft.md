<!-- default_invocation: Graft under `{target}` the child this step's routed item or handoff names: {reason}. -->
## Your step: {step} ({kind}{handoff_suffix})

- **step_ref:** {step}
- **Skill:** `{skill}`{skill_mode}. Invoke it with the Skill tool; its
  arguments are the invocation below followed by ` --unattended {step}` (a
  leading `/hsdd-...` in the invocation is dropped: the tool names the skill).
- **Target:** {target_line}
- **Report:** `{report}`
- **Decide command:** `{decide_command}`
- **Write set:** {write_set_list}, your report files, and `{experiments_dir}/`.

### What to do

follow graft mode (v0.10.0 §11.4): the new child takes the next slug; the
parent's child summaries and DAG gain it; contracts it consumes from siblings
are left to the child's phase plan's `request` entries.

### Done when

- The child's file exists and the parent names it.
- Your report validates and lists every routed item above in `closes`.
- `node hsdd/scripts/auto/gate.mjs --step {step}` passes. You may run it
  yourself before ending.
