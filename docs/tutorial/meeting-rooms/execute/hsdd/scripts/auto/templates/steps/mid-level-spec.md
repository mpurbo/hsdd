<!-- default_invocation: Decompose `{target}`. -->
## Your step: {step} ({kind}{handoff_suffix})

- **step_ref:** {step}
- **Skill:** `{skill}`{skill_mode}. Invoke it with the Skill tool; its
  arguments are the invocation below followed by ` --unattended {step}` (a
  leading `/hsdd-...` in the invocation is dropped: the tool names the skill).
- **Target:** {target_line}
- **Report:** `{report}`
- **Decide command:** `{decide_command}`
- **Write set:** {write_set_list}, your report files, and `{experiments_dir}/`.

### What to do

apply `hsdd-spec`'s rule for when to stop recursing; either decompose into
children with one file each, or mark the node `leaf-parent` and say why. When
the result changes what the parent's embedded summary or DAG says, route an
`insert-step` for a `spec-touch` on the parent.

### Done when

- The node's Kind is final and every child it names has a file.
- Your report validates and lists every routed item above in `closes`.
- `node hsdd/scripts/auto/gate.mjs --step {step}` passes. You may run it
  yourself before ending.
